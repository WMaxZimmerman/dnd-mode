** Functions   
   - dnd-select-session-target ::
     Updates org agenda files and org capture templates.
     
   - dnd-eval-charsheet ::
     Evaluates the dnd character sheet that you are currently in.
     
   - rtd ::
     Roll the dice. "Randomly" generated value for given pass ins. EX =1d20 + 1=.

** Customization
   - dnd-srd-dir ::
     This variable defines the directory location of the DnD SRD org files. These can be the files that are
     defined in the [[https://github.com/WMaxZimmerman/org-dnd-srd][org-dnd-srd]] repository, or any org files that you have for SRD files. The important thing
     to note is that the directory will need to have a =.agenda-index= file that specifies the relative paths
     (from the directory) to the files that should be added to the org-agenda.

     - Default :: =~/org-dnd-srd=

   - dnd-snippet-dir ::
     This variable defines the directory location of the yasnippets that should be toggled on when the dnd-mode
     is toggled on. This repository does have snippets stored with it inside the [[file:snippets/][snippets]] directory.

     - Default :: =~/dnd-mode/snippets=

   - dnd-org-capture-templates ::
     This variable defines the capture templates that will be used when the dnd-mode is toggled on. This repo
     comes with some basic templates that can be used, but your campaigns and characters will likely be different
     and, therefor, may need different templates.

     - Default :: a basic template for inbox TODOs and notes.
