#+TITLE: DnD Mode

* Description
  This is a minor mode for emacs that allows for the easy management of campaigns and characters for DnD. This mode
  primarily relies on [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] to be the engine of this mode. For the best use of this mode it is recommended to be
  familiar with [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Commands.html][org-agenda]] and [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Capture.html][org-capture]]. You are able to use this mode without that knowledge, but some of the
  features will be missed. The charsheet will function with emacs 'out of the box' as org is already there.

* Installation
  To use this package in your configuration you can copy the [[file:dnd-mode.el][dnd-mode.el]] file or clone this repository. To utilize
  the SRD files you can copy or clone the files in the [[https://github.com/WMaxZimmerman/org-dnd-srd][org-dnd-srd]] repository. This mode will expect those files
  to exist and will likely break if you don't at least have the =.agenda-index= file. For more information about
  where the default of this folder is expected to be or how to customize it see the [[*dnd-srd-dir][customization]] section below.

  This package will also want to utlize a set of [[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][yasnippets]] that will make editing character sheets and files easier
  when the mode is toggled on. You will likely want to at least have a valid directory set, but you can choose to not
  have any snippets in there.
   
* Usage
** Default Key Strokes - /When mode is on/
   | Shortcut | Function                  |
   |----------+---------------------------|
   | =C-c s=  | dnd-select-session-target |
   | =C-c e=  | dnd-eval-charsheet        |
   | =C-c r=  | rtd                       |

** Functions   
   - dnd-select-session-target ::
     Updates org agenda files and org capture templates.

     Roll the dice. "Randomly" generated value for given pass ins. EX =1d20 + 1=.

* Customization
** dnd-srd-dir
   This variable defines the directory location of the DnD SRD org files. These can be the files that are
   defined in the [[https://github.com/WMaxZimmerman/org-dnd-srd][org-dnd-srd]] repository, or any org files that you have for SRD files. The important thing
   to note is that the directory will need to have a =.agenda-index= file that specifies the relative paths
   (from the directory) to the files that should be added to the org-agenda.

   - Default :: =~/org-dnd-srd=

** dnd-snippet-dir
   This variable defines the directory location of the yasnippets that should be toggled on when the dnd-mode
   is toggled on. This repository does have snippets stored with it inside the [[file:snippets/][snippets]] directory.

   - Default :: =~/dnd-mode/snippets=

** dnd-org-capture-templates
   This variable defines the capture templates that will be used when the dnd-mode is toggled on. This repo
   some basic templates that can be used, but your campaigns and characters will likely be different
   and, therefor, may need different templates.

   - Default :: a basic template for inbox TODOs and notes.
